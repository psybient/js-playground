      text: `Capoeira is an African / Brazilian art form that is several hundred years old. It is neither a dance nor a martial art, it is rather a mixture of both and a little more. Capoeira is a dialogue through movement, which can develop into infinitely many nuances and sentences. Capoeira is unique in that it connects self-defense, acrobatics, rhythm and music. All in one. The details and history of this martial arts dance are old and the origin is still debated. An important role for development was the enslaved Africans. Some historians say slaves used Capoeira's dance-like style to hide their martial arts training and self-defense.`,

      text: `Capoeira's history begins with the beginning of African slavery in Brazil. Since the 16th century, Portuguese colonists began exporting slaves to their colonies, coming mainly from Angola. Brazil, with its vast territory, received most of the slaves, almost 40% of all slaves sent through the Atlantic Ocean. The early history of capoeira is recorded by Historians such as Dr desch-Obi, who provides historical context for Capoeira in Brazil.</p><p> Originally, the ancestor tradition originated from Angola and was called N'golo/Engolo; a type of ritual dance that used several elements of kicking, headbutting, slap boxing, walking on one's feet, deception, evasion etc. The purpose was also religious as it both provided a link to the afterlife (which was the opposite of the living world) and enabled a person to channel their ancestors into their dance. For example, during the dance, a person might become possessed by an ancestor in the past who was talented at N'golo. This could be applied to a Martial setting in both combat and warfare which was called N'singa/ensinga; the difference to N'golo being that it included weapon use and grappling. </p><p>During the Atlantic Slave trade, this tradition transferred around the Americas; Brazil (Capoeira), the Caribbean (Damnye) and the United States (knocking and kicking). A large amount of Angolans were sent to Madagascar during the slave trade and it still survives today as Moringue/ Moring.`,

    text:`Capoeira nowadays is not only a martial art, but an active exporter of Brazilian culture all over the world. In the 1970s, capoeira mestres began to emigrate and teach it in other countries. Present in many countries on every continent, every year capoeira attracts thousands of foreign students and tourists to Brazil. Foreign capoeiristas work hard to learn Portuguese to better understand and become part of the art. Renowned capoeira mestres often teach abroad and establish their own schools. Capoeira presentations, normally theatrical, acrobatic and with little martiality, are common sights around the world.`,
